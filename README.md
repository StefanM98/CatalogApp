Catalog App
==================

2. Navigate to the script directory
3. Start the server by running catalog.py
4. Access the app by navigating to http://localhost:5000


Description
-------------

This program will start a python (flask) webserver that provides an app where users can authenticate via Google and/or Facebook in order to modify the contents of the server database. Authenticated users are given the ability to add, edit, and delete categories and category items.

This app was created for my girlfriend's custom tutu business which is why the database pertains to tutus. However, none of the code (except some HTML) specifically references tutus meaning that the catalog can be relatively easily modified for another type of product.
